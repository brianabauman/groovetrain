Two simple programs:

(1) conductor.py 
- Allows a user to broadcast their Spotify playback to all passengers

(2) passenger.py
- Allows a user to subscribe to and mirror the current playback of the conductor

Both programs rely on
- util.py, some common utility code
- spotipy, a python wrapper for Spotify's Web API
